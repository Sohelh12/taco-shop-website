# Taco Shop Website

This is a simple, multi-page website built using **pure HTML**. It was my first project focusing on practicing semantic HTML structure and creating a consistent navigation experience across pages.

## Project Overview

The website consists of three pages:

1. **Main Page**  
   - Contains information about the taco shop.  
   - Features a price table listing different taco options, including discounted prices for purchasing multiple tacos.  
   - Includes a navigation bar for easy access to different sections and other pages.

2. **Work Hours Page**  
   - Lists the opening and closing times for each day of the week.  
   - Includes a consistent navigation bar.

3. **Contact Us Page**  
   - Contains a form where users can enter their name, email address, and leave comments.  
   - Also includes the navigation bar for consistent user experience.

## What I Learned

- Structuring multi-page websites with semantic HTML  
- Creating consistent navigation across pages  
- Basic form creation in HTML  

## How to View

You can open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the website locally.

## Next Steps

- Add CSS for styling and layout  
- Add JavaScript for interactivity  
- Deploy the website online (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
